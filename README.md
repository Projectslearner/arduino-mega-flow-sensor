# Flow Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Flow Sensor project involves using an Arduino Mega to measure the flow rate of liquid passing through a flow sensor. This project demonstrates how to interface a flow sensor with the Arduino Mega, count the pulses generated by the sensor, and calculate the flow rate in liters per minute (L/min) and flow in milliliters (ml) per minute. It provides real-time monitoring of fluid flow, making it suitable for applications requiring accurate measurement and control of liquid flow rates.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Flow Sensor (with pulse output)**
3. **Jumper Wires**
